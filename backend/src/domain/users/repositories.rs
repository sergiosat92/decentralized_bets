//! ðŸ“¦ USER REPOSITORY
//! ==================
//!
//! This module provides database access functions for the User entity using SeaORM.
//! It implements query operations such as finding users by email or by ID.
//!
//! ## Implementation Details
//! - Implements the default behavior for `ActiveModel`.
//! - Provides async functions to fetch user records from the database.
//! - Uses SeaORM's query builder for filtering and finding entities.
//!
//! ## Functions
//! - `find_user_by_email`: Searches the database for a user by their email address.
//! - `find_user_by_id`: Searches the database for a user by their unique identifier (ID).
//!
//! ## Errors
//! Both functions return `DbErr::RecordNotFound` if the user does not exist.
